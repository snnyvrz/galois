title: 'Multi Strategy Wallet'
---

Our smart contract-based wallet serves as an infrastructure solution for companies and groups that operate with shared financial decision-making. With the ability to define transaction policies, users can establish groups of sign holders, withdrawal conditions, and transaction limits as strategies for their company wallet. Each strategy undergoes a voting process, where members of the company or group have the opportunity to accept or reject proposed strategies. Once a strategy is accepted by the majority, it becomes attached to the wallet, ensuring that all transactions align with the approved policies. This transparent and collaborative approach ensures that financial decisions are made collectively, promoting accountability and facilitating efficient asset management.
Key Features:

- Customized Transaction Policies: Users can define transaction policies tailored to their specific company or group requirements.
- Strategy Voting Mechanism: Strategies proposed for the wallet are subjected to voting by members, ensuring democratic decision-making.
- Sign Holder Groups: Define and designate specific groups of individuals as sign holders, allowing for controlled access to wallet transactions.
- Withdrawal Conditions: Set conditions and requirements that must be fulfilled before a withdrawal from the wallet can be executed.
- Transaction Limits: Establish limits on strategies to manage financial activities within predefined boundaries.
- Transparent Decision-Making: The voting process and strategy acceptance/rejection status are visible to all members, promoting transparency and fostering trust.
- Efficient Transaction Execution: Once strategy requirements are met, transactions are executed promptly, ensuring a streamlined process.
- Versatile Application: The infrastructure of our smart contract-based wallet can be extended beyond companies and groups, finding utility in platforms such as crowdfunding and voting systems, where collective decision-making and transaction policies are essential.
  With our smart contract-based wallet, companies and groups can seamlessly collaborate on financial decisions, maintaining control over their digital assets while upholding the principles of collective governance.
